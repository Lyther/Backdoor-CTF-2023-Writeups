The Guessy Game:

This Game was a piece of cake. Lucky those People at Guessy Inc. are Idiots. They never change the Secret_Number.
It only took me 30 tries to get every guess right.

I remember my father's stories about our lineage being cursed by this game. That we were damned to choose 0 for eternity.
Anyways, I guess the saviour of this family was finally born. Haha.

Here are the correct Guess for the game:

Heads, Tails, Heads, Tails, Tails, Heads, Tails, Heads, Heads, Heads, Tails, Heads, Tails, Heads, Tails, Heads, Heads, Tails, Heads, Heads, Heads, Heads, Tails, Heads, Tails, Heads, Tails, Heads, Heads, Heads
